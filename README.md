# CS330 - Comp Graphic and Visualization

# How do I approach designing software?
This project has given me valuable experience in graphic design, dealing with colors, textures, transformations, and more. The process I followed for the project work was just trial and error. I made many mistakes and got stuck at times, but I learned a lot in the struggles. It will be important in any future work to continue learning through trial and error because, in my experience, you learn more through mistakes than successes.

# How do I approach developing programs?
To develop the 3D scene, I broke the project down into several smaller tasks, such as crafting the individual objects in the scene. This process of iteration helped keep me from getting overwhelmed by everything that needed to be done to complete the project. Throughout this project, my approach to developing code has changed. In the beginning, I was very overwhelmed because OpenGL was brand-new to me, so I wasn't really sure where to start. Over the course of the project, I have learned that tweaking values in different methods help me understand exactly what each function is doing and how I can manipulate the scene.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations help me in my future educational and professional pathways by providing several skills that are necessary in computer science. Some of those skills include problem-solving skills, data analysis, conceptual understanding, user experience design, and data-driven decision making.
